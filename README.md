# Don's Dotfiles

My newly-refreshed dotfiles. There's not much here for now, but I'll start
adding more of my configurations as they get to a decent state.

## Management

I manage my Dotfiles using GNU Stow:
https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/

Simple clone down this repo, move it to your preferred location (one dir
into your $HOME, and run `stow .`.

## My Environment

* Shell: Bash
* Terminal Emulator: Ghostty
* OS: macOS at the moment, but switching to Linux full time once I've found a
  WM/compositor combo that has full-screen magnification and a decent FOSS DAW.
* Editor: Neovim
* E-mail Client: Neomutt & Thunderbird
* DAW: Avid Pro Tools & MAGIX Sequoia
