# Antifiles (Antiquis' dotfiles)

## What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles are the configuration files that allow us to customise our system to our liking, so called because they usually start with a full stop ('.')!

## What programs do I use?
I make use of many programs across my systems, which include:
- Neovim
- Neomutt
- Khal, Khard and Vdirsyncer
- Alacritty
- Bash

For my desktop GNU/Linux systems, I use KDE running on ArchLinux, and tend to use Debian Stable on servers. I also use Windows with WSL for music production (unfortunately my notation / production software is not available on Linux).

## How do I manage my dotfiles?
There are hundreds of ways that one might manage their dotfiles. Personally, I use the GNU Stow, which automatically symlinks my dotfiles into the appropriate places.

## Suggestions
Any suggestions for improvements, please open an issue!
